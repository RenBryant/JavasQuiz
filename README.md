## Usage
This quiz allows the user to click a start button to begin a quiz. Clicking the button will display the question, the answer choices, and begin the timer at the top. If the user clicks the wrong answer, 15 seconds are taken off of the timer. Finishing the quiz will send the user to a screen that allows them to input their initials.

## Future Work
Local Storage still needs to be done. Can't work with the view high scores, or clear high scores until then. Will continue to work on this even after it's done but wanted to give an update.
