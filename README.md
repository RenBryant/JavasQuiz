User Story:
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the Start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

For this project, a quiz was to be created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The quiz had to be at least three questions and could be on any subject the creator preferred. I chose to create a MineCraft based quiz.

First, I created a HTML file and then linked a CSS and JavaScript file to it. Then I added some buttons, one is to display the next question, and the other was to submit the quiz.

I attempted to add a timer so that the quiz-taker would be able to see how long they took on the quiz.

I created four questions in all using the JavaScript functions, variables, and const.

I also attempted to create a restart function so that the quiz restarts itself.

Definitely needs to have some work done to make every function work and display nicely ðŸ˜•
